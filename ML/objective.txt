Objective:
We want to build a simple reinforcement learning (RL) agent to predict whether the cryptocurrency market is trending up, down, or sideways. The agent will make buy, sell, or hold decisions based on a set of technical indicators (like moving averages, RSI, volume). The goal is to train an RL model using historical price data and then evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Requirements:
Environment Setup:

The RL environment will be created using OpenAI Gym.
The state will consist of historical price data, moving averages, RSI, and volume.
The action space will consist of three actions: Buy, Sell, Hold.
Custom Gym Environment:

The environment should inherit from gym.Env.
The state should include the following indicators: price, moving averages, RSI, and volume.
The action space should allow three actions: Buy, Sell, and Hold.
The reward should be based on the profit or loss from a trade.
RL Algorithm:

Use Stable-Baselines3 and the PPO algorithm for training the RL agent.
Train the agent on historical data.
Reward Function:

The reward function should be based on the agent's profit or loss from its actions.
The agent will receive positive rewards for profitable trades and negative rewards for losing trades.
Backtesting:

Once the agent is trained, it should be tested on unseen historical data.
Implement a simple backtesting framework to evaluate the performance of the agent.
Code Structure:
Custom Gym Environment (CryptoTradingEnv):

Define the state space and action space.
Implement the reset() method to initialize the environment.
Implement the step() method to take actions (buy, sell, hold), move to the next state, and return rewards.
Training the RL Agent:

Use Stable-Baselines3 with PPO for training.
Train the model on the custom environment using historical data.
Evaluation:

Implement a testing procedure to evaluate how well the trained agent performs on unseen data.
Track the agent’s performance in terms of profit or loss.






Clarifications and Suggestions:




1. **Data Source**: 
I am getting data straight from an exchange no need to focus on that 

2. **Technical Indicators**:
   - For moving averages, do you want to use simple moving averages (SMA) or exponential moving averages (EMA)?
   - Are there specific time periods you're interested in for these indicators? (e.g., 50-day, 200-day moving averages)
   - For RSI, what's the standard period you want to use? (typically 14 days)
EMA short( 20) and EMA long(100) and RSI 14 candles is good 
3. **Risk Management**:
Lets use 1 ATR as fixed sl and tp

4. **Environment Complexity**:
   - Do you want to simulate transaction fees? NO
   - Should we include slippage in the trading simulation? NO
   - Will you need support for margin trading or just spot trading? no nee to focus on that for now.

5. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - How will you handle missing data? Don’t know just do what you think is best 
   - Do you want to implement normalization of features? Yes 
   - What time frame are you considering? (daily, hourly, minute-level data) 1 minute 

6. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Beyond profit/loss, are you interested in additional metrics like:
Only the following for now 
     * Win/loss ratio
     * Number of trades

7. **Training Considerations**: how does that impact?  I want it as simple as possible for now just to get an idea if I want to go further or not.
   - What's your computational budget for training?
   - Do you have a specific training duration or number of episodes in mind?
   - Will you use GPU acceleration?

Proposed Libraries:
- Data Collection: `yfinance` or `ccxt` / no need to implement I will do that 
- Technical Indicators: `ta-lib` or `pandas-ta`  / use pandas-ta
- Machine Learning: `stable-baselines3`, `gymnasium` (updated version of gym) / yes 
- Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy` / yes 
- Visualization: `matplotlib`, `plotly` /yes
