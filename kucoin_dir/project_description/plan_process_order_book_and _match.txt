Plan to Process Order Book and Match Data

Step 1: Understand Data Characteristics
Order Book Data:
- Dynamic size (variable number of bids and asks).
- Fields: asks (price, size), bids (price, size), timestamp, time_received.

Match Data:
- Fields: price, side, size, time, time_received.

Step 2: Define Key Metrics
Order Book Metrics:
- Bid Pressure: Bid Pressure = ∑(size of top N bids)
- Ask Pressure: Ask Pressure = ∑(size of top N asks)
- Imbalance: Imbalance = (Bid Pressure - Ask Pressure) / (Bid Pressure + Ask Pressure)

Match Data Metrics:
- Rate of Change (RoC): Measure execution speed by calculating the number and size of matches over time windows.

Step 3: Data Processing Pipeline
- Load Data:
  - Handle both real-time and historical data.
  - Normalize timestamps for consistency.

- Process Order Book Data:
  - Extract and aggregate bid and ask pressures.
  - Compute imbalance at each timestamp.

- Process Match Data:
  - Group matches by time windows (e.g., every 100ms).
  - Calculate trade volumes, directions (buy/sell), and speed (number of trades per time window).

- Merge Metrics:
  - Synchronize order book and match data using timestamps.
  - Combine metrics into a unified DataFrame for analysis.

- Visualize and Test:
  - Plot metrics like imbalance and RoC.
  - Validate with historical patterns.

Prompt: 
I need Python code to process financial market data for a momentum-based trading strategy.

Data:
Order Book: 
- Variable-length bids and asks, each with price and size, and a timestamp.

Match Data:
- Contains trade price, side (buy/sell), size, and timestamp.

Requirements:
Order Book Metrics:
- Calculate Bid Pressure: Sum of top N bid sizes.
- Calculate Ask Pressure: Sum of top N ask sizes.
- Compute Imbalance: (Bid Pressure - Ask Pressure) / (Bid Pressure + Ask Pressure).

Match Data Metrics:
- Group trades into fixed time intervals (e.g., 100ms).
- Calculate total trade volume and speed (number of trades per interval).

Synchronization:
- Merge order book and match data by timestamp.
- Create a DataFrame with metrics for each time interval.

Output:
- A pandas DataFrame with columns for bid pressure, ask pressure, imbalance, trade volume, and trade speed, synchronized by timestamp.
- Optional: Visualization of these metrics over time (e.g., using Matplotlib).

Example Data Structure:
Order Book:
{Insert the provided example of order book data here.}

Match Data:
{Insert the provided example of match data here.}

Code Requirements:
- Write modular and efficient code with functions for:
  - Parsing and processing order book data.
  - Calculating metrics for match data.
  - Synchronizing the data streams.
- Add comments and ensure code clarity.
